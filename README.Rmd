# carnaval

Carnaval is the biggest street feast of Brazil. It happens all over the country in a kaleidoscope of sound and color. One of its many shapes is the yearly competition between Samba Schools in Rio. The `carnaval` R package provides easy access to both datasets on the competition and color palettes inspired by the carioca Samba Schools. The package focuses on the main league of the competition ("Grupo Especial").

Currently, all data comes from the [Galeria do Samba](https://galeriadosamba.com.br) portal. If you like this package, please help them keeping their project afloat: [Contribua](https://galeriadosamba.com.br/espaco-aberto/contribua/).

The package is under development and has these functions:

-   get_scores: Obtain scores of samba schools by year, school and/or criterion. Data goes back since 1968;

-   get_remarks: Obtain remarks on the evaluation process. Data goes back since 1968;

-   get_parades: Obtain total scores (and more) of samba schools by year and/or school. Data goes back since 1932;

-   display_all: Plots the available Samba School palettes;

-   scale_ARG_rio_TYPE: Family of ggplot functions for plotting with Samba School palettes. Can be used to fill or color/colour (ARG) and for discrete (d) or continuous (c) scales (TYPE);

-   colorblind_friendly: Indicates whether a palette is friendly towards some types of colorblindness.

## Installation and loading

Install `carnaval` from [GitHub](https://github.com/IcaroBernardes/carnaval) as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

```

## Examples

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Loads the package
library(carnaval)

# Prints a table that shows the scores of Portela and
# Estácio de Sá on the parades of 1968 and 1970 on all criterions
